# 🚀 AI-Powered Logistics Optimization Platform

### Presented by **Team npm_run_dev**

In today’s fast-moving logistics industry, inefficient route planning, high transportation costs, and lack of real-time optimization create significant challenges. Our AI-powered logistics optimization platform ensures **smarter, faster, and more cost-effective** shipment routing. 

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Shipment Form – Intelligent Input System
The system begins with an intuitive **Shipment Form**, where users enter crucial shipment details:

- **Pickup & Destination Details**: City, country, latitude, longitude.
- **Shipment Type & Weight**: Categorization into perishable, fragile, heavy, or standard items.
- **Preferred Transport Mode**: Land, air, sea, or multi-modal options.
- **Urgency & Delivery Constraints**: Defines urgency to ensure the best-suited route.

Our system processes this data to recommend **optimized transport solutions** tailored to individual shipment needs.

### 2️⃣ Smart Route Recommendations – AI-Powered Path Selection
Based on shipment details, our platform suggests the most efficient routes, optimizing for **cost, time, and efficiency**.

✅ **Land, Sea, and Air Route Selection**
- Identifies the fastest, cheapest, or most balanced route based on real-time logistics data.
- Considers factors like **fuel costs, route restrictions, traffic congestion, and customs clearance delays**.

✅ **Multi-Modal Route Optimization**
- AI finds the best combination of multiple transport modes.
- Example: A shipment from **Mumbai to Los Angeles** may be transported via road, then shipped via sea, and finally delivered via rail or air.
- Ensures the best balance of **speed, cost, and environmental impact**.

✅ **Live Route Adjustments & Delay Predictions**
- **Real-time tracking** allows dynamic rerouting in case of traffic, weather, or regulatory issues.
- AI predicts potential delays at **customs, ports, or congested routes** and suggests alternatives.

- AI detects shipments originating from the same region (**e.g., Mumbai, Pune, Navi Mumbai**) and clusters them.
- Optimized clustering **reduces logistics costs and maximizes truck/container utilization**.

🔹 **Key Benefits of Clustered Routing:**
✅ Reduces transportation costs by **combining shipments** into multi-stop routes.
✅ Minimizes empty cargo space and maximizes **truck/container load capacity**.
✅ Enhances efficiency by reducing duplicate trips & **fuel consumption**.
